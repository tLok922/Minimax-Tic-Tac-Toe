# Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe
- Enjoy a classic board game you can play by yourself or challenge a friend!

## Features
- Implemented two fun AI agents using the Minimax algorithm
- Pick the optimal move (just hit the left button) or go for the worst move (right button).
- Don't want the AI to play the game for you? Click on the board instead!
- Added alpha-beta pruning to make the game run smoother and faster.
- Cosy paper-like background colour :)

## Have fun~
